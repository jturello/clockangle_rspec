# time/60



# write a method that tells us, given a certain time, the distance between the minute and hour hands on an analog clock. For example, 12 o'clock would return 0ยบ and 6 o'clock would return 180ยบ.
#
# Always return the smaller distance and be as precise as possible. Make sure to think about the object class of the input - all form inputs from params are strings. In order to convert a String to a Float, you need to use the String#to_f() method.
